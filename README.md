# Shiny-Windscape
Build a exe setup file for R Shiny in Windows


### ‚ú® Contents 

**Inno Setup Configuration:**
- The Inno Setup file `create_installer_.iss` contains configuration settings such as the application name, version, default installation directory, program group name, compression options, and more.
- It specifies the base filename for the generated setup file.

**File and Directory Installation:**
- The [Files] section in the Inno Setup file `create_installer_.iss` lists the files and directories to include in the installation package.
- The specified files, such as R Portable, R scripts, app files, logs, and supporting files, are copied to specific directories within the user's system during the installation process.
- The Flags parameter is used to control specific behaviors, such as marking a file as a readme file.

**Start Menu Shortcut:**
- The [Icons] section in the Inno Setup file `create_installer_.iss` defines the shortcut icon and its associated properties.
- It creates a shortcut in the Start Menu's program group, pointing to the start_app.vbs file, and sets the icon for the shortcut.

**VBScript Execution:**
- The `start_app.vbs` file is a VBScript script responsible for launching the R Shiny application.
- It creates a WScript.Shell object and runs the R script `runApp.R` using the R interpreter.
- The R script execution is performed with the specified command-line arguments, including the log file name.
- This script acts as a bridge between the Inno Setup installer and the R Shiny application, allowing the installer to launch the application during setup.

**Run Shiny App**
- The `runApp.R` script launches the R Shiny application using the following steps:
- Set library paths to R Portable`.libPaths("./R/App/R-Portable/library")`
- Load the Shiny package `library(shiny)`
- Run the Shiny application: `shiny::runApp("app", launch.browser = TRUE)`

By combining these elements, the setup file generated with Inno Setup automates the installation process for the R Shiny application. It copies the necessary files, creates shortcuts, and sets up the environment for executing the R Shiny application. Users can then run the setup file to install the application on their system with ease.
